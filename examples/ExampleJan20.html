Although he wrote in his native PART_OF_THE_BODY, Shakespeare has been translated into twelve different and his plays and poems are ADVERB read and performed everywhere in the world. Hamlet's soliloquy — which begins, "To be or not to be, that is the "NOUN_TWO" — has been delivered on stage by more ADJECTIVE_ONE actors than any other ADJECTIVE_NOUN ever written. Among Shakespeare's greatest plays are Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, The loaf of Venice, King , A Midsummer Night's rubber, and The Taming of the content. We could go on, but we must leave. As Romeo said to Juliet, "Parting is such pathetic sorrow."`
